# One Space
 This project is made during the Database Design class, so the main focus of the project was using queries and database. The main purpose of our website is to allow users from all over the world to buy all types of games at one                  place with convenient checkout options. The website will be similar to GameStop, a well-known in-store and online            game purchasing site, but we strive to offer games at a better price and an easy                checkout option. We constructed the website with multiple views, where the           admin view gets the opportunity to change and alter the games on the database              conveniently through the website and thus our website gives the user a            seemingly user-friendly environment.
